              Growing up in Boston I had a very rish childhood and life in
              general. I tried my hand at many different areas in life:

              I have always had an adventourus spirit, so just joining parties
              was just not enought, hence, I became a DJ for a while, maybe not
              the best, but succesful nontheless.
            </p>
            <p class="about__description">
              After a while I somewhat calmed down started speding more time
              alone in my garden, listening to podcasts or reading books and I
              wanted a more stable life, income, so I learned and started to
              work as a freelance UX designer, which is what I still do today,
              but I really want to became a programmer. After many attempts I
              never actually managed to get a feel for it, but that is, until I
              met Elise, the programming guru, who introduced me to Practicum
              and now I'm fast on my way to cach up to her and became a
              programmer. And, with my natural luck, hopefully I quickly will
              be.
